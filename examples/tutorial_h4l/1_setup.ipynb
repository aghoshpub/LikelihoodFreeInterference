    "If morphing is used, one also has to specify the maximal power with which the parameter contributes to the squared matrix element. For instance, a parameter that contributes only to one vertex, will typically have `morphing_max_power=2`, while a parameter that contributes to two vertices usually has `morphing_max_power=4`. Exceptions arise for instance when the interference effects between the SM and dimension-six operators are modelled, but the square of the dimension-six amplitude (subleading in 1/Lambda) is not taken into account, in which case `morphing_max_power=1`. The `parameter_range` argument defines the range of parameter values that are used for the automatic optimization of the morphing basis.\n",

This string is a python expression, in which `theta` is parsed as the parameter value. For instance, if the internal parameters are in the range (0, 1), but should be linearly scaled to (0, 100) in the param_card, one would have to use `param_card_transform=\"100*theta\"`."

    "Morphing is a powerful technique that allows for the fast and exact interpolation of event weights (or any derived quantity) from a set of original benchmark points (the \"morphing basis\") to anywhere in theory parameter space. This procedure depends on the powers with which the parameters affect the differential cross sections (this is why `add_parameter()` wants to know about this). Please see Sec. II.C.2 of [\"A Guide to Constraining Effective Field Theories With Machine Learning\"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00020) for an explanation of the techniqe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Morphing is not strictly necessary to run MadMiner, but it makes life easier in so many ways (and many methods are so far only implemented for morphing-based problems). We strongly recommend to use this wherever possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "To activate morphing, the function `set_morphing` has to be called. With the option `include_existing_benchmarks=True`, MadMiner will keep all the benchmark points defined beforehand and run a simple optimization algorithm to fix the remaining ones for the basis (which may be none). Otherwise, MadMiner will optimize the full basis and forget about all previously defined benchmark points.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other important keyword is `max_overall_power`. This sets the maximal combined power with which all parameters together contribute to the squared matrix element (cross section). This constraint is in addition to the `morphing_max_power` keyword of `add_parameter()` (see above). For instance, if there are two parameters of interest `a` and `b`, and it is known that there are contributions proportional to `1` (constant), `a`, `a^2`, `b`, `b^2`, and `ab`, then `max_overall_power=2`. If there are also contributions proportional to `a^2 b`, `a b^2`, and `a^2 b^2`, then `max_overall_power=4`."
