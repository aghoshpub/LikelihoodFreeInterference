The selected samples will all come from the event file we have so far, but their frequency is changed -- some events will appear multiple times, some will disappear.\n",

    "Second, `SampleAugmenter` calculates all the augmented data (\"gold\") that is the key to our new inference methods. Depending on the specific technique, these are the joint likelihood ratio and / or the joint score. It saves all these pieces of information for the selected events in a set of numpy files that can easily be used in any machine learning framework."
